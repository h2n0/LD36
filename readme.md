# The idea
All of this was written at the start of the event so not all of what is here will make it in, I hope it does though.


## Back story, might not be needed
The player has fallen in to a hole (I don't know why)

Before them is a shard, when they collect this shard the room lights up and a door opens.

They're informed that they need to collect 3 more shards to find their way out.

## Gameplay
Player needs to collect 3 shards to find their way out of the 'dungeon'.

Player is armed with sword and shield.

Player has limited lives (3 or 4, I'm not sure).

When a player collects a shard this gain a power, probably fire, water and something else.
